### Phase 5.1: Handoff Runtime Hardening — runtime tests and protocol docs

- Added 12 runtime tests in `tests/test_coordinator_handoff_runtime.py` covering:
  - Accept failure: sends `[agent-report] action=blocker`, adapter NOT called.
  - Accept success: sends accept report, reads bootstrap, calls adapter with bootstrap prompt.
  - Bootstrap missing: adapter still called, prompt notes bootstrap missing.
  - All report sends use `AllowedMentions.none()`.
  - Action scope: only `assignment.accept` auto-executed; `mark-done`, `closeout`, `merge`, `deploy`, `pr` all rejected.
- Created `docs/agent-report-protocol.md`: documents report format, supported actions, auto-accept behavior, and when to use Discord report vs coordinator CLI.
- Full test suite: 134 pass (122 existing + 12 new).

### Round 1 — Initial implementation

- Worker implemented all Phase 3.3 launchd artifacts:
  - 3 plist templates (`launchd/com.discord-nexus.mac-{claude,codex,opencode}.plist`)
  - Shared lib (`scripts/lib/launchd.sh`)
  - 4 management scripts (`scripts/{start,stop,status,uninstall}.sh`)
- Fixed `start.sh` plist update semantics: `bootout` + `bootstrap` cycle replaces `kickstart -k` so launchd reloads changed plists.
- Added launchd documentation section to `docs/platform-setup.md`.
- Static validation passed: `plutil` 3/3, `bash -n` all pass, 106 tests OK.
- Submitted for review.

### Round 2 — Review findings addressed

- **Finding 1**: `check_manual_process` in `scripts/lib/launchd.sh` used a narrow `pgrep -f "nexus.py --agent $agent"` pattern that missed invocations with intervening flags (e.g. `python nexus.py --config agents.toml --agent mac-claude`). Fixed to `nexus\.py.*--agent[= ]${agent}\>` which matches `--agent X` and `--agent=X` regardless of flag order.
- **Finding 2**: Closeout file list was incomplete (omitted 5 of 9 artifacts). Corrected.
- Re-validated: `bash -n` all pass. (plutil and tests unchanged from round 1.)

### Manual validation

Human performed terminal and Discord validation:

- `scripts/start.sh mac-claude` → loaded, Gateway connected.
- `scripts/status.sh mac-claude` → pid visible.
- `scripts/stop.sh mac-claude` → stopped.
- `scripts/uninstall.sh mac-claude` → plist removed.
- `scripts/start.sh` (all 3) → mac-claude, mac-codex, mac-opencode all loaded.
- Discord health check → mac-codex responded with adapter/bin/available fields.

### Current status

- Task status: **done** — all static, terminal, and Discord validation passed.
- Human gate: **passed**.
- Ready for commit and merge at human's discretion.

### Dogfood doc sync — coordinator integration docs

- Read harness state, progress, scope, architecture, domain model, and `dogfood-doc-sync` plan before editing.
- Confirmed the task already had an active coordinator lease for `mac-codex` / `auto-mac-codex-1780240587`; a duplicate `assignment accept` attempt through coordinator CLI failed because of that active lease.
- Updated current-state docs for Phase 4 coordinator integration:
  - `docs/discord-multibot-plan/multi-bot-refactor-plan.md`
  - `docs/multi-agent-harness-overview.md`
  - `docs/project-harness/runbook.md`
  - `docs/project-harness/scope.md`
- Synced wording around coordinator Discord daemon, targeted agent handoff delivery, discord-nexus coordinator handoff auto-accept, and the rule that task lifecycle state changes go through coordinator CLI rather than direct harness JSON edits.
- Sanity-checked documented coordinator commands against current `mac.sh --help` output.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed; `scripts/harness/harnessctl validate` passed; `scripts/harness/harnessctl doctor` exited 0 with existing optional/current file misses (`current/task_plan.md`, `init.sh`).
