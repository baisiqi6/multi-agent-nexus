### Phase 5.4: Workspace Doctor And Full Harness Init — implementation

- Created `src/multi_agent_coordinator/doctor.py`: workspace harness diagnostics module with `diagnose_workspace()` function. Produces a `DoctorReport` that checks workspace path, harness root, harnessctl availability/executability, required and optional file presence, checklist validity, harnessctl validate/doctor health, and distinguishes between `none`, `minimal_file_backed`, and `full_harness_runtime` modes.
- Added `workspace doctor <workspace_id>` CLI subcommand. Returns exit 0 for full_harness_runtime, 1 otherwise.
- Enhanced `init_file_harness()` in `onboarding.py` with `init_full_harness()`: copies `scripts/harness/` runtime from a `--source` directory, creates protocol file stubs (scope.md, architecture.md, domain-model.md, runbook.md), ensures minimal harness files exist. Supports `--dry-run`, never overwrites existing files, validates harness_root is within workspace path (security boundary), updates workspace `harnessctl_path` when harnessctl is created.
- Updated `workspace init-harness` CLI to accept `--mode full|minimal`, `--source`, and `--dry-run` flags. Full mode requires `--source`, minimal mode requires `--root`/`--task-id`/`--plan-doc`.
- 22 new tests in `tests/test_doctor.py`: doctor (missing path, missing root, missing harnessctl, not executable, healthy full, invalid checklist, bus note, to_dict), full init (dry-run, creates files, no overwrite, updates harnessctl_path, missing source, root outside workspace, unknown workspace, empty source, to_dict), CLI integration (doctor unknown/minimal, init full requires source, init minimal requires root).
- Coordinator test suite: 664/664 pass (642 existing + 22 new).
- Updated `docs/project-harness/runbook.md` with new workspace onboarding order (register → doctor → init-harness full → doctor verify → task create → audit).

### Phase 5.3: Agent Registry Auto-Sync — implementation

- Created `src/multi_agent_coordinator/agent_registry.py`: TOML parser for `[[agents]]` and `[[external_agents]]` that extracts `id`, `display_name`, `discord_user_id`, and `agent_type`. Skips entries missing `discord_user_id`, fails closed on duplicate IDs or Discord user IDs.
- Added `sync_workspace_agents` batch helper to `db.py` with merge (default, preserves manual overrides) and `--replace` (replaces entire registry) semantics.
- Added `workspace agent sync` CLI subcommand with `--source` and `--replace` flags. Outputs JSON summary: `added`, `updated`, `unchanged`, `skipped`, `removed` (replace only).
- 16 new tests: 6 TOML parsing, 6 DB sync, 4 CLI integration (including token leak prevention).
- Coordinator test suite: 640/640 pass. discord-nexus test suite: 165/165 pass.
- End-to-end verified: synced 8 agents from real `agents.toml` to coordinator DB.
- Updated `agents.toml.example` to mark `discord_user_id` as required for registry sync.
- Updated runbook with `workspace agent sync` commands.

### Phase 5.2: Task-Scoped Session Lifecycle — implementation

- Added canonical session scope helpers for `channel:<channel_id>`, `thread:<thread_id>`, and `task:<workspace_id>:<task_id>`, with legacy numeric scope fallback for existing sessions.
- Extended `SessionStore` with active lookup fallback, scope-prefix/task queries, and task stale/archive lifecycle operations.
- Updated coordinator handoff runtime so accepted task handoffs use task scope, resume the same task session, isolate different tasks, and archive local task sessions on coordinator closeout/done lifecycle notices without executing coordinator mutations from Discord text.
- Updated text and slash session status/reset output to show scope type.
- Updated session persistence design and runbook with task scope priority, archive semantics, and contamination troubleshooting.
- Validation: targeted session/command/handoff tests passed; full suite `.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover tests/` passed with 161 tests.

### Phase 5.1: Handoff Runtime Hardening — runtime tests and protocol docs

- Added 12 runtime tests in `tests/test_coordinator_handoff_runtime.py` covering:
  - Accept failure: sends `[agent-report] action=blocker`, adapter NOT called.
  - Accept success: sends accept report, reads bootstrap, calls adapter with bootstrap prompt.
  - Bootstrap missing: adapter still called, prompt notes bootstrap missing.
  - All report sends use `AllowedMentions.none()`.
  - Action scope: only `assignment.accept` auto-executed; `mark-done`, `closeout`, `merge`, `deploy`, `pr` all rejected.
- Created `docs/agent-report-protocol.md`: documents report format, supported actions, auto-accept behavior, and when to use Discord report vs coordinator CLI.
- Full test suite: 134 pass (122 existing + 12 new).

### Round 1 — Initial implementation

- Worker implemented all Phase 3.3 launchd artifacts:
  - 3 plist templates (`launchd/com.discord-nexus.mac-{claude,codex,opencode}.plist`)
  - Shared lib (`scripts/lib/launchd.sh`)
  - 4 management scripts (`scripts/{start,stop,status,uninstall}.sh`)
- Fixed `start.sh` plist update semantics: `bootout` + `bootstrap` cycle replaces `kickstart -k` so launchd reloads changed plists.
- Added launchd documentation section to `docs/platform-setup.md`.
- Static validation passed: `plutil` 3/3, `bash -n` all pass, 106 tests OK.
- Submitted for review.

### Round 2 — Review findings addressed

- **Finding 1**: `check_manual_process` in `scripts/lib/launchd.sh` used a narrow `pgrep -f "nexus.py --agent $agent"` pattern that missed invocations with intervening flags (e.g. `python nexus.py --config agents.toml --agent mac-claude`). Fixed to `nexus\.py.*--agent[= ]${agent}\>` which matches `--agent X` and `--agent=X` regardless of flag order.
- **Finding 2**: Closeout file list was incomplete (omitted 5 of 9 artifacts). Corrected.
- Re-validated: `bash -n` all pass. (plutil and tests unchanged from round 1.)

### Manual validation

Human performed terminal and Discord validation:

- `scripts/start.sh mac-claude` → loaded, Gateway connected.
- `scripts/status.sh mac-claude` → pid visible.
- `scripts/stop.sh mac-claude` → stopped.
- `scripts/uninstall.sh mac-claude` → plist removed.
- `scripts/start.sh` (all 3) → mac-claude, mac-codex, mac-opencode all loaded.
- Discord health check → mac-codex responded with adapter/bin/available fields.

### Current status

- Task status: **done** — all static, terminal, and Discord validation passed.
- Human gate: **passed**.
- Ready for commit and merge at human's discretion.

### Dogfood doc sync — coordinator integration docs

- Read harness state, progress, scope, architecture, domain model, and `dogfood-doc-sync` plan before editing.
- Confirmed the task already had an active coordinator lease for `mac-codex` / `auto-mac-codex-1780240587`; a duplicate `assignment accept` attempt through coordinator CLI failed because of that active lease.
- Updated current-state docs for Phase 4 coordinator integration:
  - `docs/discord-multibot-plan/multi-bot-refactor-plan.md`
  - `docs/multi-agent-harness-overview.md`
  - `docs/project-harness/runbook.md`
  - `docs/project-harness/scope.md`
- Synced wording around coordinator Discord daemon, targeted agent handoff delivery, discord-nexus coordinator handoff auto-accept, and the rule that task lifecycle state changes go through coordinator CLI rather than direct harness JSON edits.
- Sanity-checked documented coordinator commands against current `mac.sh --help` output.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed; `scripts/harness/harnessctl validate` passed; `scripts/harness/harnessctl doctor` exited 0 with existing optional/current file misses (`current/task_plan.md`, `init.sh`).
